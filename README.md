# GeekKwame — Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio built with React and Tailwind CSS. It showcases projects, experience, contact information, and interactive animations.

Quick start
- Install dependencies:

```pwsh
npm ci
```

- Start development server:

```pwsh
npm start
```

- Build for production:

```pwsh
npm run build
```

Deployment
- This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.

Notes
- `node_modules/` is ignored via `.gitignore` and has been removed from repository history to keep the repo small.
- If you want to publish under a different GitHub Pages URL, update the `homepage` field in `package.json`.

Want help polishing UI or adding projects? Tell me which sections you want redesigned and I can update components and styles.
